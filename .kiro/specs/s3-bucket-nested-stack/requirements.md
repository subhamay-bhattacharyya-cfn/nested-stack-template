# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive CloudFormation template for an S3 bucket that can be used as a nested stack template. The template will provide extensive configuration options for S3 bucket properties, lifecycle management, encryption, notifications, and access policies. The template is based on the provided s3-bucket.yaml specification and will serve as a reusable component in larger CloudFormation deployments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a comprehensive S3 bucket CloudFormation template, so that I can deploy S3 buckets with consistent configurations across different environments and projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the template is deployed THEN the system SHALL create an S3 bucket with a name following the pattern `{ProjectName}-{S3BucketBaseName}-{Environment}-{Region}{CiBuild}`
2. WHEN KMS encryption is enabled THEN the system SHALL configure server-side encryption using the provided KMS key ARN
3. WHEN bucket versioning is enabled THEN the system SHALL enable versioning on the S3 bucket
4. WHEN public access block settings are specified THEN the system SHALL apply the configured public access restrictions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cloud architect, I want configurable lifecycle management for S3 objects, so that I can optimize storage costs by automatically transitioning objects to appropriate storage classes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN lifecycle configuration is enabled THEN the system SHALL create lifecycle rules for the specified prefix
2. WHEN Standard-IA transition is enabled THEN the system SHALL transition objects to Standard-IA after the specified number of days
3. WHEN Intelligent Tiering is enabled THEN the system SHALL transition objects to Intelligent Tiering storage class
4. WHEN Glacier transitions are enabled THEN the system SHALL configure transitions to Glacier and Glacier IR storage classes
5. WHEN Deep Archive transition is enabled THEN the system SHALL transition objects to Deep Archive storage class
6. WHEN expiration is enabled THEN the system SHALL delete objects after the specified expiration period

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want comprehensive bucket policies and access controls, so that I can ensure secure access to S3 resources while preventing unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the template is deployed THEN the system SHALL create a bucket policy that denies unencrypted object uploads
2. WHEN VPC endpoint access is configured THEN the system SHALL restrict access to the specified VPC endpoint
3. WHEN whitelisted users and roles are specified THEN the system SHALL allow access only to those principals
4. WHEN IAM role access is configured THEN the system SHALL grant appropriate permissions to the specified IAM role
5. WHEN secure transport is required THEN the system SHALL deny all non-HTTPS requests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want S3 event notifications configured, so that I can trigger downstream processing when objects are created or modified in the bucket.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Lambda function ARN is provided THEN the system SHALL configure Lambda notifications for specified events
2. WHEN notification filters are specified THEN the system SHALL apply prefix and suffix filters to notifications
3. WHEN notification events are configured THEN the system SHALL trigger notifications for the specified S3 events

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive parameter validation and organized parameter groups, so that I can easily configure the template with proper validation and clear organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL validate all parameters against their constraints
2. WHEN the CloudFormation interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL group parameters logically for better user experience
3. WHEN invalid parameter values are provided THEN the system SHALL display appropriate constraint error messages
4. WHEN optional parameters are not provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible default values

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a cloud engineer, I want proper resource tagging and outputs, so that I can track resources and integrate with other CloudFormation stacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the template is deployed THEN the system SHALL tag all resources with project, environment, and GitHub metadata
2. WHEN the stack is created THEN the system SHALL output the S3 bucket ARN for use in other stacks
3. WHEN resources are created THEN the system SHALL apply consistent naming conventions across all resources
